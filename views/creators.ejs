            <h2>4. Kyle Jussab</h2>
            <p>A passionate game developer who's currently trying to become a game programmer for Naughty Dog. At the fossiled age of 22, Kyle recently moved to the Golden State of California where he is also enrolled in a community college studying game design. As you would imagine he doesn't have a lot of free time, but fingers crossed his dreams of working for Naughty Dog come true.
                <br><br>
                Kyle was responsible for the frontend development of PixelPulse, so if you're unhappy with the look and feel of PixelPulse he's the one to blame!
